# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will go through the entire process of creating a new character controller, step-by-step. This will cover a wide variety of features, and will give you an overview of all the different ways this character controller can be customized.

The tutorial can be followed without downloading the final project, but the completed tutorial project can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/CharacterControllerSamples/tree/master/Tutorial)

Note 1: Throughout this tutorial, the code samples will often have chunks of excluded code in order to show only the important parts that you need to add or modify. The `// (...)` represents excluded code.
